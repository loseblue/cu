# Introduction

Initial focus is on implementation of the Sockets Extension API as defined in [RFC 6458](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6458.txt) that is ergonomic and that should work with any `async` toolkit in Rust. Current implementation is targeted for Linux based systems. These APIs are *not* a wrapper over [`lksctp`](https://lksctp.sourceforge.net/), but instead provide all the APIs that make use of Rust's types like `enum`, `Vec` etc. Eventually it should be possible to have `SCTP` as a first class citizen in the Rust's `async` ecosystem.

In particular this implementation utilizes the `SCTP` stack in the Linux kernel, unlike other approaches like [webrtc-sctp](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc/tree/master/sctp) which is trying to build entire `SCTP` stack in the user-space and is primarily targeted for running `SCTP` over `DTLS` sockets.

Please see [compatibility](#compatibility) for current feature support.

# Compatibility

## `async` Runtime Supported.
- The implementation supports [Tokio `async` runtime](https://tokio.rs/).

## SCTP Feature Support

This section captures the current support for `SCTP` features with [RFC 6458](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6458.txt) as a reference. In particular, features marked as `DEPRECATED` in the said RFC are not implemented. Since the Sockets Extension API defined in the RFC describes an API based on C programming language, there is not one to one mapping in the implementation, see notes for further details.

Notes:
1. The `drop` implementation on the socket 'close'es the socket, hence no explicit `close` call supported.
2. All the Send and Receive functions are available as two APIs `sctp_send` and `sctp_recv`, hence no separate implementation for the C like system calls.
3. This API is not required to be implemented in Rust.
